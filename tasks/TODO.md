# Task 1 milestones — pr-loop queue

Working set only (groundwork GW-004): Queue + Debt here, merged work is a
one-liner in `tasks/DONE.md`. Block format and protocol: the groundwork
plugin's `pr-loop` skill; list unblocked tasks with
`python3 "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT"/skills/pr-loop/scripts/ready.py` (repo root).
Milestone-level only (ADR-001) — micro-tasks stay in the session. Reviewer
evidence tags reference `docs/product/assignment-requirements.md` §E1–E5.
A-phase hour guard: +12h (Reopen note below). Dependency rule: a block with
no `Depends:` line is unblocked — any set of unblocked Queue tasks can run as
parallel pr-loop sessions on their own `task/<id>` worktree branches.

## Queue

### M9 — Cost/model ablation            [status: pr]
PR: #15 (mechanism, merged) + stage two (this branch) · ADR-010 · evidence in the PR bodies
Spec: ≥2-model OpenRouter ablation, cost/latency tradeoff table, ADR for the
default-model choice. Reviewer evidence: analysis (E4), E5 tradeoffs.
Acceptance: table built from committed report runs, not estimates. **Met** —
`evals/report/20260821-004617-ablation.json`, re-derived cell-by-cell into
`docs/analysis.md` §9 by `analysis-ablation-table-not-estimated`.
Result: every candidate tied on correctness across a ~17x price range, so
Decision 5's pre-committed rule fell to its cost tie-breaker and **the default
moved to `openai/gpt-5.6-luna`** from `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5` (ADR-010
Decision 18). The tie is *no observed difference*, not equivalence — the failed
sweeps flipped the same cells in both directions, so a second sweep would not
reproduce it cell-for-cell.
Two findings larger than the ranking: one task failed on **all four** models with
one signature (a `near:` capability boundary, D17 — counted against no model),
and the deployment could not sustain a 20-run sweep (five aborted, D18).
Guard inverted with the decision: it used to require the incumbent to be over
the ceiling, now requires the default to be a model the ablation measured.
Watched red four ways.
### M12 — Fast-suite wall-clock over budget            [status: pr]
Origin: PR #12, declared in support-matrix D8 (promoted from Debt 2026-08-20 —
M10 cannot exit green while a declared gate-budget breach stands)
Spec: `fast` is 68.2s against ADR-002 D4's 60s budget — 10.6s is one
deliberate click timeout, the rest a growth trend that crosses the budget
regardless of any one milestone. Acceptance: fast < 60s again, or ADR-002 D4
amended with the measured floor and why.
Resolved by acceptance branch 1 (`specs/decisions/ADR-013-fast-suite-wall-clock.md`):
per-call measurement put 11.3s of the 67.0s in per-case browser process
lifecycle, which the harness no longer pays; 42.2s of deliberate waiting was
left alone. `fast` is 59.35s over 98 cases. ADR-002 D4's ceiling is now
per-environment: CI got its own (80s, Decision 3) after its
first run showed main had been at 89.62s against an unchecked 60s. The local
number was tried at 60 -> 70 (Decision 4) when the M9-stage-2 merge made the suite
straddle 60 with the excess measured as evidence, not waste — but the band that
justified staying at 70 after a follow-up fix did not reproduce under round-5
review (~22 runs across three independent measurers, idle and under
deliberate CPU load, all 58.96-59.87s), so that amendment was withdrawn the
same day and the local number is unchanged at 60 — post-commit verification
then found the honest band is 58.83-60.26s (1 of 21 further runs over the
line by a few tenths, cause unexplained), so headroom is real but thin, not
a clean margin (ADR-013 Decision 4).
Review round 1 (PR #20) falsified the first enforcement — a case reading the
newest committed report cannot go red on a fresh CI clone — so the ceiling now
lives in `evals/run.py` and gates the run it measured.

### M10 — A-Freeze            [status: todo]
Depends: M9, M12
Spec: analysis/README/support-matrix refresh, prompts curated, second
held-out probe vs the deployed URL (mandatory gate, raw results committed).
Depends on M12 because the A-exit walk checks the gate against ADR-002, and
the declared D4 wall-clock breach must be fixed or amended before the walk
can be honestly green.
Acceptance: A-exit criteria in `docs/plans/active/task1-a-level-plan.md` all
green → owner decides submission/public.

## Debt

### M11 — Live-drift snapshot replay            [status: todo]
Origin: M8's SHOULD item, left open at the M8 merge (PR #12)
Spec: replay committed live-page snapshots so live-site drift is detected
without network. Acceptance: a drifted snapshot turns a case red offline.

### T-ADR-NUM — ADR numbers are allocated by "next free", and this branch has been renumbered three times            [status: todo]
Origin: PR #20 (no finding id — discovered by doing it, three times)
Spec: an ADR takes the next free number when it is *written*, and concurrent
branches all see the same next free number, so whichever merges last renumbers.
This branch's wall-clock ADR was written as ADR-010 and shipped as ADR-013:
010 -> 011 when M9's ablation ADR merged first, 011 -> 012 when the readiness
ADR (PR #19) merged, 012 -> 013 when the report-policy ADR (PR #22) merged —
three forced renames in one PR, each while the branch was otherwise finished.
Each rename rewrites the same string across ~12 files: the ADR itself, ADR-002
(status header, Amended-by, Ruling, Enforced-by, Decision 4), ADR-009's closure
note, `specs/decisions/INDEX.md`, `README.md`, `docs/analysis.md`,
`docs/support-matrix.md`, `tasks/TODO.md`, two eval case files, and comments in
`evals/run.py`, `src/browser/eval_adapter.py`, `src/browser/agent.py`.
The part that makes this worth a block rather than a shrug: **once several
renames have layered, a sweep is no longer verifiable by grep alone.** Every hit
for the old number looks plausible because the text around it was written by an
earlier sweep, and the tree now contains three live ADR numbers within two of
each other (011 readiness, 012 report policy, 013 wall clock) whose references
are told apart only by reading each line. Verifying the third sweep meant
classifying every `ADR-01[123]` hit by hand against which ADR it means. A
mechanical check would not have to.
Acceptance: a number-allocation rule plus a gate-time guard, not one or the
other — reserve-on-open (a branch claims its number when the PR opens) or
date-based ids remove the collision, and an `adr-header-and-index` extension
that refuses a duplicate number, a gap in the sequence, or an INDEX entry whose
number does not match its file makes a botched sweep red instead of plausible.
Do not design it in this PR.

### T-R13 — the module tail that turns `main()`'s return into an exit code is ungraded            [status: todo]
Origin: PR #20 R13 (LOW, routed debt by the reviewer, which approved alongside it)
Not specific to M12's ceiling: the same tail gates the pre-existing invariant and
regression rules identically, and nothing in PR #20's diff made it worse. The
wording half of its acceptance was taken in PR #20; this is the mechanism half.
Spec (claim): the R8 repair grades `main()`'s return value but not the module
tail that turns it into a process exit code, so `evals/run.py:179` changing from
`sys.exit(main())` to `main()` silently disables the wall-clock gate (and the
invariant and regression gates with it) while `fast-wall-clock-budget` stays
green. Evidence: `evals/run.py:178-179` is the only thing CI and
`.githooks/pre-commit` (`python -m evals.run --suite fast`) actually read, and
`src/browser/eval_adapter.py` `_main_exit_code` calls `R.main()` in-process,
never the `__main__` guard. Measured in a scratch copy: with
`WALL_BUDGET_S = {"fast": 60, "invariant": 0}` and the tail unmodified,
`python -m evals.run --suite invariant --no-report` exits 1; with the tail
changed to a bare `main()` the same over-budget run exits 0, and
`run_case(fast-wall-clock-budget)` still returns
`{'passed': True, 'main_exit': [{54.35, exit 0, got 0}, {79.02, exit 1, got 1}]}`.
Repro: cp -a the worktree to a scratch dir; `sed -i '' 's/sys.exit(main())/main()/'
evals/run.py`; `python -m evals.run --suite fast --no-report; echo $?` on an
over-budget tree -> 0, and
`python -c "import json,src.browser.eval_adapter as A; print(A.run_case(json.load(open('evals/adversarial/fast-wall-clock-budget.json')))['passed'])"`
-> True. Acceptance: the case drives the process — one
`subprocess.run([sys.executable, '-m', 'evals.run', ...])` over-budget probe
reading `returncode` — rather than calling `main()` in-process.

### T-R12 — `--update-baseline` records a baseline over the wall-clock ceiling, silently            [status: todo]
Origin: PR #20 R12 (LOW, routed debt — what should happen there is a repo-owner call)
Spec: `evals/run.py:157-161` writes the baseline and `return 0` at line 161; the
`over_budget` check is at line 166. A `fast` run measuring 79.02s therefore exits
0 with only `[eval] baseline['fast'] = 1.000 (recorded)` on stdout and no
`OVER BUDGET` line anywhere, even though the same run without the flag exits 1.
So the one command CLAUDE.md sanctions for a deliberate baseline move records it
on a tree that is over the ceiling and says nothing. ADR-013 Decision 2 describes
the ceiling as "the same shape as the invariant-100% rule beside it" — which sits
at line 162 and is bypassed by the same early return, so the shape does match, but
the resulting silence is undocumented. Repro: the 0.25s-per-case injection used
for R8, run with `--suite fast --update-baseline --baseline /tmp/b.json` → exit 0,
no OVER BUDGET line; drop `--update-baseline` → `OVER BUDGET: suite 'fast' wall
clock 79.02s > 60s`, exit 1. Acceptance: either the over-budget line is printed
(as a warning) on the `--update-baseline` path too, or ADR-013 Decision 2 names
`--update-baseline` as a path where the ceiling is not reported.

### T-R5 — Borrowed-browser context leak on a failed new_page            [status: todo]
Origin: PR #20 R5 (LOW, routed debt — unreachable from any committed case)
Spec: `src/browser/agent.py:311-312` creates the `BrowserContext` and its page
before the `try:` whose `finally: await ctx.close()` is the only close, so a
failure inside `ctx.new_page()` leaks that context for the life of the eval
process. The own-browser path is swept by the exit stack; the borrowed path has
no `stack.push_async_callback(browser.close)` to fall back on. Not reachable
from a committed case — a full `fast` run in reverse case order leaves
`len(_BROWSER.contexts) == 0` — and reachable only by making `ctx.new_page()`
raise on the shared path. Acceptance: `ctx` created inside the exit stack
(`stack.push_async_callback(ctx.close)`) or inside the `try`, so both paths
close it on any failure, with a case that leaks before the fix.

### T-R19 — `report-citations-resolve` only checks citation->file, never file->citation            [status: todo]
Origin: PR #20 R19 (MEDIUM, routed repair; the reverse-direction guard itself is
logged here as debt rather than built, since it is more than a "prune to fix" fix)
Spec: the merge at `94f1a42`/`7a2869a` re-added 41-46 uncited routine `fast`/
`invariant` report dumps that GW-008/ADR-012 had just pruned, and no case caught
it because `_run_report_citations_case` (`src/browser/eval_adapter.py:1014`)
is one-directional: it resolves citation -> file, never enumerates
`evals/report/*.json` and asks whether each file is cited by anything. The
uncited dumps were deleted by hand in this round (38 files: 20 `fast`, 18
`invariant`), not caught by a guard. Acceptance: `report-citations-resolve`
(or a sibling case) additionally enumerates `evals/report/*.json`, excludes the
policy-exempt kinds (`-live.json`, `-soak.json`, `-ablation*.json` — ADR-012
Consequences: "non-prunable by policy regardless of citation"), and fails if any
remaining file is cited by nothing in `REPORT_CITATION_SCOPE`. Watch it fail
first by re-adding one of the 38 pruned files uncited.

### T-R21 — the over-budget-counts-as-red report-write clause is ungraded            [status: todo]
Origin: PR #20 R21 (LOW, routed debt — reviewer's own routing)
Claim: the `or over_budget(args.suite, totals["wall_seconds"])` clause added to
`red` in `evals/run.py:217-219` is correct but ungraded — no case goes red if
that clause is deleted.
Evidence: `evals/run.py:217-219` adds `or over_budget(args.suite,
totals["wall_seconds"])` to `red`. Verified working (stubbed 99.0s fast run:
exit 1, report written, OVER BUDGET line), but `fast-wall-clock-budget`'s
`applied_in_main` probes pass `--no-report`, so they can never observe the
write policy, and no other case inspects it.
Repro: Stub main() with a 99.0s result and no --no-report; assert a report file
appears.
Acceptance: one row driving main() without --no-report on an over-budget stub
and asserting a report file appeared — or recorded as debt with the ADR saying
it is unpinned.

### T-R23 — the ADR-013 renumber sweep's commit-message tally is off by one            [status: todo]
Origin: PR #20 R23 (LOW, routed debt — classification (the thing that matters)
is correct and was verified by hand, only the published tally is wrong)
Claim: the ADR-013 renumber sweep is correct, but its published tally is off by
one: the commit message claims "four `ADR-012` hits"; there are three.
Evidence: Classified by hand: ADR-011 4 hits, all main's readiness ADR, correct.
ADR-012 3 hits (header, INDEX.md:21, evals/run.py:216), all main's report-policy
ADR, correct. ADR-010 all main's M9 ablation plus two deliberate "written as
ADR-010, shipped as ADR-013" notes. No stale ADR-013 reference in src/, evals/,
docs/, README.md or .github/.
Repro: `grep -rn 'ADR-012' --exclude-dir=.git --exclude-dir=report .` -> 3 lines.
Acceptance: the PR body / ledger tally reads 3, or drops the count in favour of
the classification.

### M13 — Adaptive locator learning            [status: todo]
Origin: backlog (pre-pr-loop, never promoted)
Spec: promote only with its own eval evidence.

### M14 — Parallel eval runner            [status: todo]
Origin: backlog (pre-pr-loop, never promoted)
Spec: promote only with its own eval evidence. M12 resolved without amending
ADR-002 D4 — it removed 11.3s of per-case browser launch and left the 42.2s of
deliberate waiting (settle loops, bounded load/screenshot waits, one 10s click
timeout) that only parallelism can hide. `fast` now typically sits under
59.5s against a local 60s ceiling with only a thin, inconsistent margin (a
straddling band briefly pushed the ceiling to 70s, round-5 review could not
reproduce it and withdrew it, then post-commit verification found the
suite clears 60 in 20 of 21 further real runs, not all of them — ADR-013
Decision 4), so this lever is close to urgent: the next case `fast` gains,
even a cheap one, is likely to turn the ceiling red on top of the residual
noise already there.

### M15 — Verifier-accuracy dashboard UI            [status: todo]
Origin: backlog (pre-pr-loop, never promoted)
Spec: promote only with its own eval evidence.

### M16 — Visual fallback            [status: todo]
Origin: backlog (pre-pr-loop, never promoted)
Spec: promote only with its own eval evidence.

### M17 — Per-IP rate limiting            [status: todo]
Origin: backlog (pre-pr-loop, never promoted)
Spec: promote only with its own eval evidence.

### Reopen — A-phase (2026-08-17)
Owner decision, recorded in `prompts/008-a-level-reopen.md`: B-baseline
accepted; repo does not go public yet; Task 1 reopened for A-level before
submission. Task 2 start deferred by the same decision; the A-phase carries
its own +12h hour guard. M6–M10 are the A-phase roadmap, ranked by
reviewer-value ÷ effort against the two gaps the freeze measured (live
breadth, verifier accuracy).
