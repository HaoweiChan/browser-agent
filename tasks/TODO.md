# Task 1 milestones — pr-loop queue

Working set only (groundwork GW-004): Queue + Debt here, merged work is a
one-liner in `tasks/DONE.md`. Block format and protocol: the groundwork
plugin's `pr-loop` skill; list unblocked tasks with
`python3 "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT"/skills/pr-loop/scripts/ready.py` (repo root).
Milestone-level only (ADR-001) — micro-tasks stay in the session. Reviewer
evidence tags reference `docs/product/assignment-requirements.md` §E1–E5.
A-phase hour guard: +12h (Reopen note below).

## Queue

### M9 — Cost/model ablation            [status: todo]
Spec: ≥2-model OpenRouter ablation, cost/latency tradeoff table, ADR for the
default-model choice. Reviewer evidence: analysis (E4), E5 tradeoffs.
Acceptance: table built from committed report runs, not estimates.

### M10 — A-Freeze            [status: todo]
Depends: M9
Spec: analysis/README/support-matrix refresh, prompts curated, second
held-out probe vs the deployed URL (mandatory gate, raw results committed).
Acceptance: A-exit criteria in `docs/plans/active/task1-a-level-plan.md` all
green → owner decides submission/public.

## Debt

### M11 — Live-drift snapshot replay            [status: todo]
Origin: M8's SHOULD item, left open at the M8 merge (PR #12)
Spec: replay committed live-page snapshots so live-site drift is detected
without network. Acceptance: a drifted snapshot turns a case red offline.

### M12 — Fast-suite wall-clock over budget            [status: todo]
Origin: PR #12, declared in support-matrix D8
Spec: `fast` is 68.2s against ADR-002 D4's 60s budget — 10.6s is one
deliberate click timeout, the rest a growth trend that crosses the budget
regardless of any one milestone. Acceptance: fast < 60s again, or ADR-002 D4
amended with the measured floor and why.

### M13 — Adaptive locator learning            [status: todo]
Origin: backlog (pre-pr-loop, never promoted)
Spec: promote only with its own eval evidence.

### M14 — Parallel eval runner            [status: todo]
Origin: backlog (pre-pr-loop, never promoted)
Spec: promote only with its own eval evidence; M12 is the motivating symptom.

### M15 — Verifier-accuracy dashboard UI            [status: todo]
Origin: backlog (pre-pr-loop, never promoted)
Spec: promote only with its own eval evidence.

### M16 — Visual fallback            [status: todo]
Origin: backlog (pre-pr-loop, never promoted)
Spec: promote only with its own eval evidence.

### M17 — Per-IP rate limiting            [status: todo]
Origin: backlog (pre-pr-loop, never promoted)
Spec: promote only with its own eval evidence.

## Notes

### Reopen — A-phase (2026-08-17)
Owner decision, recorded in `prompts/008-a-level-reopen.md`: B-baseline
accepted; repo does not go public yet; Task 1 reopened for A-level before
submission. Task 2 start deferred by the same decision; the A-phase carries
its own +12h hour guard. M6–M10 are the A-phase roadmap, ranked by
reviewer-value ÷ effort against the two gaps the freeze measured (live
breadth, verifier accuracy).
